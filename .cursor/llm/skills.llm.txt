# Skills.sh Documentation

## Overview

Skills.sh is a platform for discovering, installing, and using reusable capabilities for AI agents. Skills provide procedural knowledge that helps agents accomplish specific tasks more effectively. Think of them as plugins or extensions that enhance what your AI agent can do.

## What are Skills?

Skills are reusable capabilities for AI agents. They provide procedural knowledge that helps agents accomplish specific tasks more effectively. Skills function as plugins or extensions that enhance AI agent capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install a skill, use the `skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

This command installs the skill and makes it available to your AI agent.

## Skills Leaderboard and Ranking

The skills leaderboard ranks skills based on anonymous telemetry data collected from the `skills` CLI. When users install skills, aggregated usage data helps surface the most popular and useful skills in the ecosystem.

### Telemetry and Privacy

- Telemetry is completely anonymous
- Only tracks which skills are being installed
- No personal information collected
- No usage patterns collected

## Discovering Skills
