## Specialized Execution Capabilities

In addition to the planning framework, this skill includes 9 specialized capabilities for technical execution:

### 1. Technology Selection

Helps teams make informed technology decisions using structured frameworks, decision matrices, and constraint-based recommendations.

**When to use**: "What tech stack should we use?", "Help me choose technologies", "What database should we use?"

**Process**:
1. Define constraints (team size, expertise, timeline, budget, scale, compliance)
2. Select architecture pattern (monolithic vs microservices, serverless vs traditional, event-driven vs request-response)
3. Layer-by-layer selection (language/runtime, framework, database, hosting, authentication, monitoring)

**Output**: Technology recommendation matrix with trade-off analysis and implementation guidance.

**References**: Planning Section 4 (System Architecture & Design), Planning Section 5 Part 1 (Technical Execution Workflow), `docs/reference/TECHNICAL-SUMMARY.md` (in parent project)

### 2. Architecture Documentation

Documents architecture decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) with context, alternatives, and consequences.

**When to use**: "Create an ADR", "Document this decision", "Architecture decision record"

**Process**:
1. Generate ADR number
2. Capture context and problem statement
3. Document decision and rationale
4. Analyze alternatives considered
5. Document consequences (positive and negative)
6. Save to `docs/adr/` directory (in parent project)

**ADR Template Structure**:
- Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- Date and stakeholders (Deciders, Consulted, Informed)
- Context section
- Decision section
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Alternatives considered with pros/cons

**References**: Planning Section 4 (System Architecture & Design), Planning Section 13 (Lessons Learned), `docs/adr/` directory (in parent project)

### 3. Code Quality Enforcement

- Longed For: What did we long for?

**References**: Planning Section 9 (Execution Strategy), Planning Section 5 Part 6 (Technical Execution Workflow), Planning Section 13 (Lessons Learned)

### 6. Risk Management

- Technology limitations

**Organizational Risks**:
- Team member departure
- Scope creep

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:
Assess each risk by:
1. Probability: Low/Medium/High

3. Mitigation: Specific actions
4. Contingency: Backup plan
5. Owner: Responsible person

**References**: Planning Section 8 (Risk Management), Planning Section 5 Part 5 (Technical Execution Workflow), Planning Section 12 (Governance)

### 7. Automation Orchestration

Orchestrates project automation scripts for setup, validation, and deployment.

**When to use**: "Set up Claude skills in this repo", "Validate the skills setup", "Deploy the skills to git", "Run the automation scripts", "Improve or refactor our setup scripts"

**Core Principles**:
1. Use existing scripts first before writing new ones
2. Idempotent operations (safe to re-run)
3. Minimal assumptions (standard POSIX shell and git)
4. Explicit side effects (state what files/git state will be modified)

**Primary Scripts** (in parent project):
- `scripts/claude-skills/setup-claude-skills.sh` - Create skill directory structure
- `scripts/claude-skills/validate-claude-skills.sh` - Verify skills are correctly set up
- `scripts/claude-skills/deploy-claude-skills.sh` - Commit and push `.claude/` to git
- `scripts/claude-skills/tech-stack-validator.sh` - Validate proposed tech stack choices

**Workflows**:
1. Initial Skills Setup
2. Validate Skills Setup
3. Deploy Skills to Git
4. Validate Proposed Tech Stack
5. Add New Automation Script

### 8. Web Application Testing

Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright.

**When to use**: Testing frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, viewing browser logs

**Approach Decision Tree**:
- Static HTML: Read HTML file directly to identify selectors, then write Playwright script
- Dynamic webapp: Use `scripts/with_server.py` for server lifecycle management

**Helper Scripts** (in parent project):
- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern**:
1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
3. Identify selectors from rendered state
4. Execute actions with discovered selectors

**Best Practices**:
- Use bundled scripts as black boxes
- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors (text=, role=, CSS selectors, IDs)
- Add appropriate waits

**Example**:
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173')
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
    # ... automation logic
    browser.close()
```

### 9. Web Artifact Building

Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies.

**When to use**: Complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components (not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts)

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

**Process**:
1. Initialize project: `bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>` (in parent project)
2. Develop artifact by editing generated code
3. Bundle to single HTML: `bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` (in parent project)
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Design Guidelines**: Avoid excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font to prevent "AI slop".

**Scripts** (in parent project):
- `scripts/init-artifact.sh` - Initialize React project with full configuration
- `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` - Bundle React app into single HTML file
